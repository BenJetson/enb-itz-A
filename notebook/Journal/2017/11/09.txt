===== Journal =====

Today we finally finished our new base. Now that it’s big, we don’t have to worry too much about a top-heavy robot, which means no tipping over. The other thing that we did was reinforcing an axle on our arm. Though it’s small if wasn’t done we wouldn’t be able to drill a hole into our sprockets. This is important because previously, our axle wouldn’t move as nice as we wanted it to move. Now with a drilled hole it should move freely.
