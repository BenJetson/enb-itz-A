* Shoulder spacing
* Single axle through wrist
* Re-made base

===== Journal =====

Today we had to edit our shoulder spacing. They were too close together so editing the spacing was very beneficial to having our robot work. We also put a single axle through the wrist of the robot. We obviously need an axle so we added one. Luckily, we didn’t need a high strength axle to do this, so we didn’t need to drill holes in our c-channels. Lastly, we finished our base again. It is now re-made for our needs. The main goal is to get the perfect size for a pneumatic mobile goal lift.
