===== Journal =====

Today we started our code for our robot. This code will let us control our robot. It'll make our robot's motors move, which means that we can move our robot's wheels and move our robot's arm and claw. The reason why we need this code is so that we can operate our robot without this code we wouldn't be able to even move the robot
