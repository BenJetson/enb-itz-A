===== Summary =====
* We came up with even more ideas:
	* Spike Arm
	* Spatula Arm
	* Compression Scissor lift
* We decide on what wheels we'll use;
	* Omni Wheels

===== Journal =====
The first idea we came up with today was a spike arm. The idea of the spike arm is to use one standoff to hook onto the hole at the top of the cone. This would be very easy to build and maintain, but has some drawbacks. Firstly, the cone must be in exactly the right position to grab it. The cone can only be picked up when the hole is facing the robot. With cones placed randomly on the field, this wouldn't be efficient. Secondly, it isn't a very precise placement mechanism. It would be very hard for the driver to control exactly where cones went when the arm lowered.

The next design we came up with was the spatula design, which involves a flat surface that goes under the mobile goals and lifts them up. If we could get accurate control on this, it would be a very easy way to pick up a mobile goal. We have concerns though that it might not be able to drop mobile goals into the 20 point zone because of the square shape and inability to dump accurately.

The third idea we had was a compression-style scissor lift. This could pick up mobile goals from the side and cones from the top. Plus, if we used a 4-bar lift, it would be easy to build and control. However, in further testing, we discovered that trying to pick up mobile goals on the side wouldn't work well â€” the notches on the side are not deep enough to really grab it. We decided to archive this as a potential idea for a cone-only lift mechanism.
