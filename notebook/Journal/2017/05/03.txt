===== Summary =====

* Took a look at the new game
* Started coming up with some ideas:
	* Dumper Bot
	* Claw-bot

===== Journal =====

Today, our team met to watch the game reveal and get a feel for the new game. Our initial impression was that this game seems more complicated compared to last season. Right away, we started brainstorming some basic ideas. 

The first idea that came to mind was a dumper bot. This design was very popular last season, and at first glance appeared to have some application to this new game. We did a brief sketch, which is included below. Ultimately, we decided that it wasn't a viable choice. For one, the robot would not be able to put regular cones on mobile or stationary goals since the dumper bot cannot precisely place items. However, some parts of this design might be usable on a future robot.

The second idea that we had was another single-mechanism robot: a claw-bot. These are fairly common, and have the benefit of being able to precisely place game objects. While this might work for cones, it definitely would not be able to lift mobile goals.

These initial designs helped us to realize that we were going to need multiple mechanisms to work with the different game elements â€” one mechanism wouldn't be able to do both tasks well. We decided to each come up with more designs before the next meeting.
