===== Summary =====
* We designed a new claw mechanism to reduce weight.
* We decided to move the parallel bars in the back to an internal position.
* We replaced a motor that was broken.

===== Journal =====
Our previous claw design was inefficient because of its weight and size. Because of this, we decided to redesign the claw. The new design includes a bent piece of metal with rubber bands attached by screws and bearing flats. Rubber bands will give our claw grip (this was also used on our original design). With the new design, the claw is lighter and can still pick up cones. The new design resolves the weight issue we had with the old design.
