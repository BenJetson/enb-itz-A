===== Summary =====
* Fixed chain length on left side.
* Finished assembling smaller gearbox.
* Came up with plans to attach gearbox/claw to arm.

===== Journal =====
Today we focused on the gearbox. We furthered progress with it by removing unnecessarily wide c-channels and replacing them with 2x12 aluminum c-channels. We are making the entire claw mechanism out of aluminum to make it less of a load on the motors that will be lifting the arm.
