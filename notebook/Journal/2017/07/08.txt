===== Summary =====

* Started brainstorming & discussing drive train designs
* Disassembled old base
* Started building drive train

===== Journal =====

Today was focused on getting our old base taken apart. We had a 45-degree omniwheel design, which we will be discarding this year in favor of an updated and more clean (literally) design. We want to use a square design that incorporates two separate drive trains connected by a bar or plate of some sort. This design will give us more room for mechanisms to pick up mobile goals and cones. Also, this will allow for easier modification and adjustments in the future (future-proofing for the win!). We hope to further develop this design as the summer meetings continue.
Also, we started coming up with some more ideas for pickup mechanisms. Our best one so far is probably "The Spatula". As the name implies, it incorporates a large, flat, rectangular piece that will scoop up mobile goals and carry them to their destination. This design is our favorite so far for a few reasons: first, it is easily to prototype and build. Second, it is simple to modify and make quick adjustments on the fly, an especially critical quality to have during a tournament. Last, but certainly not least, The Spatula is something different and unique that will provide us with an interesting and educational mechanism to build. This design will have its own quirks and kinks to work out, such as how to power it and in which position should it be on our robot: front or back? Ultimately, this design has many strengths, and we may end up using it.
