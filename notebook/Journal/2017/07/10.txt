* Finished disassembly of old base
* Continued work on new base

===== Journal =====

We furthered progress on disassembling our old base as a continuation from our work on Saturday. We finished this task today and took care to make sure that each usable part was sorted into the appropriate location. We threw out any large parts that were broken and kept the small ones, such as gears and axles, so that we might be able to use them in a small role in the future. (UPDATE: We're glad we did this, as we have used some stripped gears for support on our columns!)
We also continued to generate ideas and started building our new base design. It incorporates omni wheels for smooth movement and a separated drive train design that allows us to fit a large mechanism that can hold mobile goals in between them. We will have to be careful to not make these too wide so that they will be able to fit inside of the 18'x18'x18' (collapsed) size requirement. This design also uses a sprocket-and-chain system to allow us to use more space up front for other mechanisms.
