===== Journal =====

Today, I (Ben) worked on updating the code to match our current robot state.

Originally, we'd planned to use a two-motor claw design for greater torque, but our current claw only has one. We found that as lightweight as cones are, a single motor was sufficient. I removed the associated motor declarations from the config and updated the references.

Also, I've added support for the upcoming mobile goal lift that we're planning to add. As of now, we expect it to use two motors and be controlled using the d-pad on the joystick. I've added control system and joystick support for now, and we can tweak speed values later as necessary.

// insert main.c

// insert control.c
