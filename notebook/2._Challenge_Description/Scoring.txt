===== Non-Scored Actions =====
There are certain actions that aren't scored in the Vex 2017-18 game, In the Zone. If you are touching a mobile goal when time runs out, then you don't get the points for the mobile goal's placement nor the amount of cones stack on said mobile goal. This can also majorly effect your chances at getting highest stack. Cones also don't count as stacked if they aren't fully stacked on the stationary or mobile goal. Also make sure that you lay only 1 mobile goal in the 20 pt. zone. You can't have more than one.

===== Basic Strategies =====
There are some basic strategies you might want to look out for. One is very simple try to move the mobile goal in it a zone before stacking any cones onto it. This is useful for many things: It ensures that cones won't fall down, I gives you less of a chance rushing to get the mobile goal to a zone, which could possibly increase the chances of you holding onto it when time runs out, cones will help go to the objective of getting the most cones in a zone. Also you should aim for parking your robot on one of the tiles, that extra 2 points can make a difference between a win and a loss.
