====== b. Mobile Goals ======

AUTHOR: @cdunla6940

There are a total of 8 mobile goals on the field, 4 red and 4 blue.. Mobile goals are 9.6 inches high, have an outer diameter of 10 inches, and weigh approximately 3.7 pounds. Cones can be stacked on top of mobile goals to earn points 2 points. Placing these mobile goals in the 5 pt, 10 pt, and 20 pt zones will yield the respective amount of points. 

Picking up mobile goals will present a major challenge for robots. These are potentially the highest scoring objects in the whole game, so being able to maneuver them well will be critical to success in matches. Firstly, mobile goals are quite heavy. Mechanisms that pick up mobile goals will require a significant amount of torque to pick them up. Secondly, these will need to be dropped into the scoring zones, so lift mechanisms must also be able to dump mobile goals. Thirdly, if teams want to stack cones on top of mobile goals while moving them around the field, they will need to find a way to keep the bottom steady as the center of gravity changes with the cones.
