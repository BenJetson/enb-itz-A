===== Game Objective and Overview =====
This season's VRC game is called //In The Zone//. The objective of the game is to earn more points than the opposing alliance by moving //Mobile Goals// into //Scoring Zones// and by stacking //Cones//. Additional bonuses are available for other actions such as //Parking//, //Autonomous//, and //Highest Stacks//. This game is a very different challenge from previous seasons, but shares the same basic ruleset as previous games.

===== The Field =====
On the field, there are total of 80 cones and 10 mobile cones (5 red and 5 blue). There also two stationary goals, one for each color. At opposite ends of the field, there are three //Scoring Zones//, one for each alliance. In the first //Zone//, //Mobile Goals// are worth 5 points, 10 points in the second, and //20 points in the last.//
This year, the starting position for robots at the beginning of the match  in the 5 point //Scoring Zone//, the back of the robot touching the first pipe. After this, the autonomous period.
TODO: @bgodfr5236 finish this

===== Autonomous and Driver Control Period =====
An autonomous period begins at the start of each match, where robots try to score the most points in 15 seconds. During the autonomous period drivers or anyone else near the field are not to touch or control the robot. The robot should be controlled by code during the autonomous period. After the 15 seconds the referees will determine which team gained the most points. The team with most points will be granted a 10 points as a bonus. After the autonomous there'll be a driver control period. This lasts 1 minute and 45 seconds. Here the drivers will have control of the robot and try to score points until time runs out.
